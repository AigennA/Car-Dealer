SOLUTION SUMMARY: GitHub Pages Home Page Visibility Issue
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
--------
Your GitHub Pages website was showing only the README text instead of the 
actual car dealer website. This happens when GitHub Pages is configured 
incorrectly.

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
GitHub Pages was likely set to "Deploy from a branch" mode instead of using 
"GitHub Actions". In this mode, GitHub serves the repository files directly,
showing README.md as the homepage instead of your built Next.js website.

WHAT WAS DONE:
--------------
1. Verified that the build process works correctly
   ✓ The site builds successfully
   ✓ index.html is generated with correct content
   ✓ All static pages are properly created

2. Confirmed the deployment workflow is configured correctly
   ✓ GitHub Actions workflow is set up properly
   ✓ The workflow deploys the built files from the 'out' folder

3. Added comprehensive documentation:
   ✓ Enhanced README.md with prominent warnings and instructions
   ✓ Created DEPLOYMENT.md with step-by-step guide
   ✓ Added troubleshooting section
   ✓ Kept the screenshot in README as you requested

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
--------------------
To fix your website, you need to configure GitHub Pages settings:

1. Go to https://github.com/AigennA/Car-Dealer
2. Click "Settings" tab (top right)
3. Click "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Find the "Source" dropdown
   - Change it from "Deploy from a branch" to "GitHub Actions"
5. The settings save automatically
6. Go to the "Actions" tab and wait for the deployment to complete
7. Visit https://AigennA.github.io/Car-Dealer/

You should now see your actual car dealer website!

VERIFICATION:
-------------
✓ Correct: You see the car dealer website with Swedish text "HITTA DIN NÄSTA BIL"
✗ Still wrong: You see README text with markdown formatting

DETAILED GUIDES:
----------------
- Quick reference: See the warning box at the top of README.md
- Step-by-step guide: Read DEPLOYMENT.md
- Troubleshooting: Check the troubleshooting sections in both files

NOTE:
-----
- The screenshot in your README.md has been kept as you requested
- No code changes were made - only documentation improvements
- Your website files are all correct and ready to deploy
- You just need to configure GitHub Pages settings once
